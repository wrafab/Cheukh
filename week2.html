  <p> Then, we also designed our own thing in Fusion 360. I watched the teaching videa, but I didn't follow it, I used it's model structure and made my own phone stand that fits my samsung C9 Pro just right. </p>
  <p> It is very difficult to make since there are separate five parts of the stand. After some struggle, I finally figured it out :) </p>
