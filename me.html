  <h1> 'Bout me </h1>
  <h2> lil' intro~ in case if you don't know me... </h2>
  <br>
  <p> So this website is all about how a boy named Ivan tried his best to survive in Digital Fabrication Course </p>
  <p> And guess what? That is me :) I am Ivan, a sophomore in Western Reserve Academy </p>
  <br>
  <p> I am from Hong Kong, I am 16 years old. </p>
  <p> You can consider me a thinker, I really like creating stuff and art. </p>
  <p> But sometimes I just can't think of any good ideas under pressure. I have high standards for myself, for every project. So sometimes it can be frustrating... </p>
  <p> I am here is explore and learn something about new technologies! I am most excited about making a clock of my own, because I can combine ideas together and draw on the clock at the same time </p>
  <p> I love making designs, but not as much when it comes to coding... </p>
  <p> So I am gonna keep this short, hopefully you appreciate my projects :D </p>
