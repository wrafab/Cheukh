  <h1> Week 3 </h1>
  <h2> Garment, UV and Sublimation </h2>
  <p> In this week, we first designed and printed a T-shirt with the design of Ohio theme (trying to describe Ohio). This is challenging to me since I don't live here. But I soon find the signature characteristics of Ohio, the states shape and pumpkin festival. </p>
  <p> I figured since Ohio is very green/ natural than Hong Kong, I will add some water or nature imagery to my T-shirt. </p>

  <p> Then, we learned how to used UV laser printing. I made my own pop socket design using laser print. It was drawn in Photoshop by myself </p>

  <p> Finally, we learned how to use Sublimation to make custome designs. I chose to make a pocket to hold my art supplies. It really came in handy~ </p>
  <p> The design is my favorite animation characters, since I started art by drawing those, it always reminds me of my art when I saw that cartoon. </p>
