  <h1> Week 3 </h1>
  <h2> Garment, UV and Sublimation </h2>
  <p> In this week, we first designed and printed a T-shirt with the design of Ohio theme (trying to describe Ohio). This is challenging to me since I don't live here. But I soon find the signature characteristics of Ohio, the states shape and pumpkin festival. </p>
  <p> I figured since Ohio is very green/ natural than Hong Kong, I will add some water or nature imagery to my T-shirt. </p>

  <p> Then, we learned how to used UV laser printing. I made my own pop socket design using laser print. It was drawn in Photoshop by myself </p>
