  <h1> Week 1 </h1>
  <h2> Designer challenge </h2>
  
  <p> Today, we are challenged to maximize two builds using plastic straws and newspapers. The first challenge is to build a support with six straws that avoid the falling golf ball to hit the ground. </p>
  <p> Our first approach is to build a little basket to hold the golf ball. However, we have insufficient material, plus tape and straws doesn't work well together. </p>
  <p> Our final product is a half broken nasket xD. We failed but we learned the strongest holding pattern is cross by cross. </p>
  <br>
  <p> The second project is building the tallest tower with newspaper </p>
  <p> Our group started off just building rolls of paper hoping to stack them high. But soon I realised we need to roll the paper into cones, stack them going smaller as it goes bigger. </p>
  <p> It was a good idea, but we failed to physically roll them into nice shapes... unlucky xD </p>
  <br>
  <p> Anyway, it was fun to think and take on those challenges even if we failed. We learned some physics xD. </p>
