    <h1> Week 5 </h1>
    <h2> 3D Printing and Scanning </h2>
    <p> We finally got into 3D printing this week, I'm so excited :P </p>
    <p> First, we had a lesson on the basic concept behind 3D printing. I leanred that we have three dimensions x, y and z, and how it works is the computer turn each coordinate of the object into a bunch of binary numbers and send it to the machine to tell it where is build. </p>
    <p> 3D printing is a kind of additive manufacturing, it build on a flat surface with molten liquid and dry it later into a hard object. </p>
    <p> It is very nice and easy but there are some limitation such as it is very slow to print something small. Also, it prints with supports that sometimes is hard to remove after the printing. </p>
