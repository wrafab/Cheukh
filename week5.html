    <h1> Week 5 </h1>
    <h2> 3D Printing and Scanning </h2>
    <p> We finally got into 3D printing this week, I'm so excited :P </p>
    <p> First, we had a lesson on the basic concept behind 3D printing. I leanred that we have three dimensions x, y and z, and how it works is the computer turn each coordinate of the object into a bunch of binary numbers and send it to the machine to tell it where is build. </p>
    <p> 3D printing is a kind of additive manufacturing, it build on a flat surface with molten liquid and dry it later into a hard object. </p>
    <p> It is very nice and easy but there are some limitation such as it is very slow to print something small. Also, it prints with supports that sometimes is hard to remove after the printing. </p>
    <p> It's advantage over Formlab is that it can produce much higher quality and resolution object than Formlab. Also, 3D printing can make hollow objects. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <p> The first project is to combine my head scanned by machine with another object. </p>
    <p> Since I love the game League of Legends, plus I main Yasuo, so I downloaded a Yasuo model. </p>
    <p> Then, using Mesmixer, I cut off Yasuo's head and after modifying my own head (add two horns and bigger eyes), I combined the two pieces and made it hollow. </p>

    <p> Then, I designed a 3D object that can't be made subtractively. The first instinct is something hollow, since there will be no penetrable surface to get in, subtractive manufacturing can't do that. </p>
    <p> I looked up a Mario mystery box, then using mesmixer, I made it hollow. </p>

    <p> Finally, the task is to make a useful item. I made a container since I need something to organize my stuff on my desk. </p>
    <p> I downloaded a simple box and robotic legs online. Then using fusion 360, I added pattern and outer design to it. Lastly, I used mesmixer to combine the legs and the box. This resulted better than I thought, the box is fairly cute and I can use it to contain school supplies and dictionaries. </p>
