  <h1> Week 6 </h1>
  <h2> Molding and Casting, Skateboard making </h2>
  <br>
  
  <p> The first part of this week is Molding and Casting, I had learned this last year from Learn to Make. It is always nice to make my own chocolate again. </p>
  <p> So I decided I would like a cool dragon head chocolate this time. I searched up online, the one I found is too detailed, so I modified it and made it simpler using Fusion360. </p>
  <p> Then I send it to Mr. Gerber to make the mold (negative). </p>
  <p> Finally, I poured in both white and black chacolate to finish it, it's delicious :) </p>

  <p> Then, here comes the hard part. We have to make a skateboard of our own. </p>
  <p> I chose to make a normal curved skateboard. The gluing part was so hard, we glue seven pieces of wood together (horizontal x 5, vertical x 2), by using Titebond III glue where it got all over the place xD.</p>
  <p> Then, we put it in the bag and vacuum it. I sealed the opening neatly and carefully, so it stayed vacuum pretty nicely. I got a nice curve on my board. </p>
  <p> After taking out the curved board, I had to reglue some part of the edge again because it still wasn't nicely pressed together. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Finally, after all the wood works, I get to design it. I chose to spray paint the whole back of the board into a galaxy style (black background with different colors randomly assigned) </p>
  <p> I left the front empty, sicne I want to keep the wood texture and I don't wanna step on the design all the time when I'm using the skateboard.
