  <h1> Week 6 </h1>
  <h2> Molding and Casting, Skateboard making </h2>
  
  <p> The first part of this week is Molding and Casting, I had learned this last year from Learn to Make. It is always nice to make my own chocolate again. </p>
  <p> So I decided I would like a cool dragon head chocolate this time. I searched up online, the one I found is too detailed, so I modified it and made it simpler using Fusion360. </p>
  <p> Then I send it to Mr. Gerber to make the mold (negative). </p>
  <p> Finally, I poured in both white and black chacolate to finish it, it's delicious :) </p>
