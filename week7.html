  <h1> Week 7 </h1>
  <h2> Electronics and Soldering </h2>
  <p> This week we learned about electronics and how to solder... (it's gonna get textual :P) </p>
  <p> First, I learned how some of the common conponent does: </p>
  <p> Capacitor is used to hold and store energy. Transistor act as a switch that can transfer energy. </p>
  <p> Resistor slow down the the electric flow by applying resistance. LED is a light that transfer chemical energy into heat and light energy (emits light) </p>
  <p> Diode control the direction of the flow of electricity. Potentiometer is used to measure the amount electrical current to flowing through it. </p>
  <p> Breadboard is a board for making an experimental model of an electric circuit (connected through different points). </p>
  <p> Multimeter is used to measure electric current or voltage or resistance of a circuit. Switch is used to connect or cut a circuit. </p>
