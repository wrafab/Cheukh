  <h1> Week 7 </h1>
  <h2> Electronics and Soldering </h2>
  <p> This week we learned about electronics and how to solder... (it's gonna get textual :P) </p>
  <p> First, I learned how some of the common conponent does: </p>
  <p> Capacitor is used to hold and store energy. Transistor act as a switch that can transfer energy. </p>
  <p> Resistor slow down the the electric flow by applying resistance. LED is a light that transfer chemical energy into heat and light energy (emits light) </p>
  <p> Diode control the direction of the flow of electricity. Potentiometer is used to measure the amount electrical current to flowing through it. </p>
  <p> Breadboard is a board for making an experimental model of an electric circuit (connected through different points). </p>
  <p> Multimeter is used to measure electric current or voltage or resistance of a circuit. Switch is used to connect or cut a circuit. </p>
  <br>
  <p> The difference between voltage, current and resistance is: </p>
  <p> Voltage is the amount of electrons flowing through, current is the space (width) where the electrons are flowing through (speed of the flow), resistance is the amount of external force that slows down the flow. </p>e amount of external force that slows down the flow. </p>
<p> The difference between AC and DC is: </p>
<p> DC is direct current, where electric charge (current) only flows in one direction. While AC is alternating current, where it changes direction periodically. </p>
