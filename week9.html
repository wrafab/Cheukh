  <h1> Week 9 </h1>
  <h2> Arduino and electronics </h2>
  <br>
  
  <p> This week, we learned all about Arduino. It is microcontroller platform that is easy to use for electronics projects. </p>
  <p> It allows us to connect electronics through its pins so we can control things. </p>
  <p> We finished every single project on the Sparkfun Inventors Kit Guide book, it took quite long but it is interesting to see how Arduino works. </p>
  <p> We did projects like blink LED, photoresistor, buzzer, the game simon says, distance sensor, LCD display screen, motor and even an autonomous robot at last </p>

  <p> Then, I processed to play around with the code myself, like changing it and using different variables. </p>
  <p> So here is one of the changed code: </p>
  <p> #include <LiquidCrystal.h>         

LiquidCrystal lcd(13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8);

void setup() {

  lcd.begin(10, 4);
  lcd.clear();
}

void loop() {

  lcd.setCursor(0,0);
  lcd.print("I FEEL ALIVE!!!");    

  lcd.setCursor(0,3);
  lcd.print(millis()/1500);
    }  </p>
