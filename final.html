  <h1> Final Project!!!!! </h1>
  <h2> Here she comes... </h2>
  <p> I spent quite a bit of time coming up with an idea for the project. I was struggling until I started thinking about things that can be helpful to me. </p>
  <p> I am in afternoon art right now, and a lot of my art supplies were scattered in different places in my room. There's too many things like crayons, different type of erasers, different type of pencil (2B,4B,8B), colors... </p>
  <p> So here comes my idea, an art supply box! Something that's colorful and can carry all of my stuff. (it's like a toolbox but with art) </p>
  <br>
  <p> So finally... here we go, start working! </p>
  <br>
  
  <a href="Boxes.makerbot" target="_blank">Container original file</a>
  <br>
  <p> I made most part of the box in wood, while there would be smaller and prettier containers inside. Then I also used fabric on the top as cover of the box. </p>
  <p> First, I 3D printed the smaller containers. I used Fusion 360 to design a Lego-like box (with lid). It's basically just a box with cylinders on its sides and top/bottom (one positive, one negative) so it can be pluged into each other. </p>
  <p> Here's a fun fact, the container is suppose to be a square box, but then I think about it... I can't hold much with that (not even a crayon) So last second, I changed it's diameters in Makerbot app to make it a long rectangle. </p>
  <p> Then I finally printed the box, I set it to be auto-fill supports. </p>
  <p> There are four total containers with two lids, you can stack them on top of each other or besides each other. </p>

  <p> Second, I started the wood working to make the structure of my box. I used very thin wood for the outer wall so the box would not be too heavy. But those thin layer can't connect with each other just by themselves. </p>
  <p> So I used thicker wood sticks to make a hollow rectangle. I nailed it on the base which made nailing the walls so much easier. </p>
  <p> Since I need to make a style of tool box, so I cut another thin wood into trapizium shape to make a higher handle on top of the box. </p>
  <p> Finally, I added the trapizium on the sides, and then nailed in the handles. I got my wooden structure now :) </p>
  <br>
  
  <a href="pencil holes.cdr" target="_blank">Laser cut board original file</a>
  <br>
  <p> Third, I laser cut a piece of 3/8 wood with dimension of half of the wodden box. It is cut with lots of tiny holes in them so my different pencils and pens would fit through. </p>
  <p> It is place inside the box, with the thick wooden square in the bottom, it is several cm above the bottom of the wooden box. </p>
  <p> To vector a piece of 3/8 wood, the setting of the machine is power 100, speed 8. It's dimension is 5 by 8 inches (on Print setting). </p>

  <br>
  
  <p> Lastly, I sewed 2 piece of similar themed, different pattern fabric together to make the cover of the box. I had to do a french sew like the one in the pillow case, so that it hides the sewing line on my fabric (in the back). </p>
  <p> Also, I cut another green fabric into six small pieces to stick them in the bottom of the box for decoration. </p>
  <br>

  <br>
  
  <p> Finally, I painted all of the sides and the pieces of the big wooden box with spray paint. The color is combined in a random way (expressing my art style) mostly black, white and red. </p>
  <p> After combining all of the pieces together, puting stuff in the right place, the art toolbox is finished!!! Now I can put my art supplies in there :P </p>

  <br>
  
  <p> I spent around a class and a half to think of an idea. Then, I started working on 3D and laser printing in around one more class. </p>
  <p> Most of my time is used on spray painting and wood working. I spend three afternoons after school working on that plus sewing. </p>
  <p> I spent so much time on my project, I am the kind of person where if I don't have an idea, I don't spent time on it. But once I got a cool idea, I want to make it the best I could (same as my art :P) </p>
  <p> In total, I spent around 6-7 hours (plus Sunday afternoon, excluding time of thinking and doing this webpage). I think it's so worth it since I can finally clear up my stuff and have a clean inventory of art supplies. </p>
  <br>
  
  <p> In general, I learned so much in this class, especially in this final project. Most important thing is time management!!! We are desginers here, no one is telling us when to do what, but we have to finish it in time. </p>
  <p> It's important to know how to plan. Plus I learned how to use the pressurized nail gun, it really save my time by a lot. </p>
  <p> Also, I learned how to use the other sewing machine (kinda different~). Finally, I learned laser cutting and how to use lots of the wood cutting machines back in WIC~ </p>
  <p> In conclusion, I'm happy to be in this class to learned all about designing and making useful or fun stuff :D </p>
