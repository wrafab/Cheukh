  <h1> Final Project!!!!! </h1>
  <h2> Here she comes... </h2>
  <p> I spent quite a bit of time coming up with an idea for the project. I was struggling until I started thinking about things that can be helpful to me. </p>
  <p> I am in afternoon art right now, and a lot of my art supplies were scattered in different places in my room. There's too many things like crayons, different type of erasers, different type of pencil (2B,4B,8B), colors... </p>
  <p> So here comes my idea, an art supply box! Something that's colorful and can carry all of my stuff. (it's like a toolbox but with art) </p>
  <br>
  <p> So finally... here we go, start working! </p>
  
  <p> I made most part of the box in wood, while there would be smaller and prettier containers inside. Then I also used fabric on the top as cover of the box. </p>
  <p> First, I 3D printed the smaller containers. I used Fusion 360 to design a Lego-like box (with lid). It's basically just a box with cylinders on its sides and top/bottom (one positive, one negative) so it can be pluged into each other. </p>
  <p> Here's a fun fact, the container is suppose to be a square box, but then I think about it... I can't hold much with that (not even a crayon) So last second, I changed it's diameters in Makerbot app to make it a long rectangle. </p>
  <p> Then I finally printed the box, I set it to be auto-fill supports. </p>
  <p> There are four total containers with two lids, you can stack them on top of each other or besides each other. </p>
  <br>
  
  <p> Second, I started the wood working to make the structure of my box. I used very thin wood for the outer wall so the box would not be too heavy. But those thin layer can't connect with each other just by themselves. </p>
  <p> So I used thicker wood sticks to make a hollow rectangle. I nailed it on the base which made nailing the walls so much easier. </p>
  <p> Since I need to make a style of tool box, so I cut another thin wood into trapizium shape to make a higher handle on top of the box. </p>
  <p> Finally, I added the trapizium on the sides, and then nailed in the handles. I got my wooden structure now :) </p>
  <br>
  
  <p> Third, I laser cut a piece of 3/8 wood with dimension of half of the wodden box. It is cut with lots of tiny holes in them so my different pencils and pens would fit through. </p>
  <p> It is place inside the box, with the thick wooden square in the bottom, it is several cm above the bottom of the wooden box. </p>
  <p> To vector a piece of 3/8 wood, the setting of the machine is power 100, speed 8. It's dimension is 5 by 8 inches (on Print setting). </p>
