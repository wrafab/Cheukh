  <h1> Week 4 </h1>
  <h2> Laser Cutting </h2>
  <p> This is my favorite week so far! I had been waiting to make my own designed clock for so long. </p>
  <p> My design surrounds a girl holding an umbrella background. It was combined with lots of different pictures. Like flower and other symbols. </p>
  <p> I learned to used trace bitmap to outline image and use trim to cut out extra line and combine all the images into one piece. The idea behind this is nature and human thoughts on it. </p>
  <p> After it is cut by laser printer, I colored it with both spray paint and water color on it. It is a masterpiece :) </p>
  <p> I am very satisfied with the result :D </p>
