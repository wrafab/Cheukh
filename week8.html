  <h1> Week 8 </h1>
  <h2> Sewing and Embroidery </h2>
  
  <p> First off, I need to desgin a file that is used to sew on a hat by the machine, Tajima Sai. </p>
  <p> I roughly drew a picture of a cool looking face in photoshop using my wacom board :), then I set up the frame (it was pretty hard since my hat's material is too hard). </p>
  <p> I layed two layers of backing, the first is just another plain fabric, the second is a layer wet-laid nonwoven backing. </p>
  <p> After changing the needle and the bobbin, the machine quickly embroyed the nice rough image on my hat. </p>
  <br>
  
  <p> After making the hat, we went on to something more manual, sewing. </p>
  <p> We spent one class talking about the basics and then we need to make our own pillow case using three different patterned fabric. </p>
  <p> I chose three bright warm colored fabric for a gift for my mom. The process is pretty complicated, we first pin the two fabric together, then roll it inside out and pin the third. </p>
  <p> We sew one straight line to connect the three fabric, then we roll the front back out. </p>
  <p> After ironing it, we cut the extra fabric and sew the rest of the sides to seal the pillow case (except one way for the entrance) </p>
  <p> Then we iron it again, Finally, we flip the pillow case inside out and do a French sew on the egde. </p>
  <p> Dah Dah~ we got our custume made pillow case :) </p>
  <p> The biggest challenge is the very first pinning part, where I need to be so careful not to pin and sew in a slightly off angle. </p>
  <p> I learned how to control the direction of sewing and lining up the place where I need to sew
