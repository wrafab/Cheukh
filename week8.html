  <h1> Week 8 </h1>
  <h2> Sewing and Embroidery </h2>
  
  <p> First off, I need to desgin a file that is used to sew on a hat by the machine, Tajima Sai. </p>
  <p> I roughly drew a picture of a cool looking face in photoshop using my wacom board :), then I set up the frame (it was pretty hard since my hat's material is too hard). </p>
  <p> I layed two layers of backing, the first is just another plain fabric, the second is a layer wet-laid nonwoven backing. </p>
  <p> After changing the needle and the bobbin, the machine quickly embroyed the nice rough image on my hat. </p>
  <br>
  
  <p> After making the hat, we went on to something more manual, sewing. </p>
  <p> We spent one class talking about the basics and then we need to make our own pillow case using three different patterned fabric. </p>
